This took me a while and sometimes I even forgot to do something from those steps. Then I came to an idea to make a script that does all that for me. Basicly this script will change the mac address to a random one and will pick a random hostname from specified file.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN BY: Andrei Zgirvaci\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This is only for testing purposes and can only be used where strict consent has been given.
